# MathAnime
This repo includes animated math videos coded in python using Manim.\
The following videos are available:
- pythagore
- triangulation
- cycloide\
For each project, 2 versions are proposed: a first one without any voiceover or sound added to the video, a second with an AI-based voiceover (using GTT service) in French.\
These videos have been created using Python-based Manim and the Manim voiceover libraries. A big thank you to Manim community (https://www.manim.community/).

## Pythagore
In this video, we demonstrate a geometric proof of Pythagora's theorem that says that, in a right triangle, the sum of the square of the hypothenuse is equal to the sum of the square of teh other sides. We also investigate what happens if the initial triangle is not right and how does that impact the final result. This leads to AlKisha's theorem.

## Triangulation
How do you measure in practice the distance between two points very far away from each other, possibly hundreds of kilometers away? Triangulation is one way to do that. In this video, we first present a reminder of the law of sines in any triangle. This serves as a basis for the triangulation which is presented in a second part. The initial distance is broken down into several smaller pieces computed from triangles that share a common side. Measuring angles and using the law of sines in these triangles yields the distance we're trying to measure. A full example is then proposed with 2 points in the triangulation at the end of the video.

## Cycloid
What is the curve described by a point located at the edge of a wheel that rotates at a constant speed on a straight line. This curve is called a cycloid. In this video, we show several examples of cycloids with points located at different height in the radius of the wheel. What does this figure look like if the wheel is no longer a circle but a regular polygon. Watch the video to discover.
